# SKU_Autofiller
A Revit add-in built in C# (Visual Studio) that automatically propagates SKU metadata from conduit fittings to connected conduit runs. Designed to reduce manual parameter entry and improve consistency across large MEP models, this tool helps standardize data for BOM generation and prefabrication workflows.
